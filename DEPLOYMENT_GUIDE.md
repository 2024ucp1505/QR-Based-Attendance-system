# 🚀 Deployment Guide

This guide outlines how to deploy the QR Attendance System.

## 1. 🖥️ Backend Deployment (Render / Railway)

We recommend **Render** or **Railway** for free/easy Node.js hosting.

### Steps for Render:
1.  Push your code to GitHub.
2.  Create a new **Web Service** on Render.
3.  Connect your GitHub repository.
4.  **Root Directory**: `server` (Important!)
5.  **Build Command**: `npm install`
6.  **Start Command**: `npm start`
7.  **Environment Variables**:
    - `NODE_ENV`: `production`
    - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: (Your Google IAM email)
    - `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY`: (Your Google private key. **Note:** If copying from a `.env` file, ensure newlines are preserved. On Render, you can paste the whole key including `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`.)
    - `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID`: (ID from your Google Sheet URL)
    - `PORT`: `5000` (Render usually sets this automatically, but good to ensure)

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not provide Google Sheets credentials, the server will switch to **Memory Mode**. All data will be lost when the server restarts (which happens frequently on free tiers).

## 2. 🌐 Frontend Deployment (Vercel / Netlify)

We recommend **Vercel** for Vite/React apps.

### Steps for Vercel:
1.  Go to Vercel and **Add New -> Project**.
2.  Import your GitHub repository.
3.  **Root Directory**: Edit this to select `client`.
4.  **Framework Preset**: Vercel should auto-detect **Vite**.
5.  **Environment Variables**:
    - `VITE_API_URL`: The URL of your deployed backend (e.g., `https://your-app.onrender.com/api`)
6.  Click **Deploy**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A `vercel.json` file has been added to the `client` folder to handle routing (so refreshing a page like `/faculty` doesn't give a 404 error).

## 3. 🧪 Testing the Deployment

1.  Open your deployed frontend URL.
2.  **Faculty**: Go to "Faculty", create a session.
3.  **Student**: Open the same URL on a mobile device, go to "Student", and scan the QR code generated by the faculty.
4.  **Verification**: Check if the attendance appears in the session list or Google Sheets (if configured).

## 4. 🔑 Authentication

**Current Status**: Authentication is **BYPASSED**.
- No login is required.
- The system identifies users based on the route they access (`/faculty` vs `/student`).
- This is intended for testing functionality before securing the app.
